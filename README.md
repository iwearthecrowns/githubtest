Added a sprite and set its position to the top left corner of the game screen. Went through the process of committing changes to GitHub to see what happens to readme.md and appearance of icons on MakeCode screen.

Project open on another computer is spinning/buffering- is not loading
GitHub icon at bottom of screen is showing pull (down) arrow
